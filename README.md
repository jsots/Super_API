# Welcome to the World of Supers!

> This website allows you to view various heroes and villains alike. Here you will find their names, stats, alignemnt, and their publisher.

## Intro

I created a front-end application for an API that contains information on various Supers (heroes and villains). This website offers full CRUD functionality with the API, allowing you to directly manipulate the back-end from the front-end!

[Deployed Site](https://main--singular-raindrop-95fa30.netlify.app/)

Here, you will be able to view the various Supers and edit their information, add a new super, or delete the current one. 

## Installation
1. Fork and clone this repo
2. Install the dependencies by typing in the command below:

```
npm i
```
3. Once they have been downloaded, you can launch a local version of the site by typing the following command:

```
npm run start
```

## Updating a Super

If you would like to update the information for any of the Supers in the database, you can enter the information into the input fields. Once you have entered everything (**and make sure you enter all the fields**), then hit enter or submit. If you fail to fill out a field, the information will be cleared. 

## Creating a Super

In order to create a Super, you need to enter their information into the fields provided. If any fields are left blank, they will just be empty in the fields above. None of the information is required in order to create an entry. 

## Deleting a Super

Deleting a Super is as easy as clicking the button! It will delete the Super that you are currently viewing.
